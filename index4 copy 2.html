    <div id="Jsr">Jamshedpur (Hindi: [d͡ʒəmˈʃeːd̪pʊɾ] ⓘ; Bengali: [ˈd͡ʒamʃedpuɾ]), also known as Tatanagar, is a major
        industrial city in eastern India.[7][8][9] It is the largest city in the state of Jharkhand. With a population
        of 629,658 in the city limits and 1.3 million in the wider metropolitan area, Jamshedpur is the third largest
        metropolitan area in the region and 36th largest urban area in the country and 72nd most populous city in the
        country.[10][11][12] Located on the confluence of Swarnarekha and Kharkai rivers, Jamshedpur is surrounded by
        the Dalma Hills.[13][14][15]

        The modern city is built over the village of Sakchi near the Kalimati Railway Station. It was chosen by Dorabji
        Tata as an "ideal location" for the development of Asia's first iron and steel plant and a planned industrial
        city, visioned by his father Jamsetji Tata, the founder of Tata Group. The project began in 1908; the steel
        factory was completed in 1908 and the city was established in 1919, named as Jamshedpur by Lord Chelmsford. The
        city played an active role in the World War I. It was a high value target for Japan during Second World War,
        prompting the British Administration to deploy British and American troops across the city.

        Following the independence of India in 1947, the city became part of Bihar's Singhbhum district. Jamshedpur was
        affected severely by the communal riots in 1964 and 1979. In the 1980s, the city experienced a rise in crimes
        particularly in northern Jamshedpur, notably the assassinations of politicians and mafia leaders in 1989 and
        1994, which decreased later. Jamshedpur was a centre of the statehood movement. On 15 November 2000, the city
        became part of newly-formed Jharkhand state.

        A major commercial and industrial centre in India, Jamshedpur is demographically diverse city. It has been
        ranked consistently as one of the cleanest cities in India by Swach Survekshan, 2nd in India in terms of quality
        of life. Jamshedpur is one of the fastest-growing global cities in the world and first smart cities in India
        along with Naya Raipur. It is a local popular tourist destination known for its forests and ancient temples.
        Jamshedpur is the only million plus city in India without a municipal corporation.

        Etymology
        In 1919 Lord Chelmsford named the city, which was previously a village called Sakchi, Jamshedpur in honour of
        its founder, Jamshedji Nausserwanji Tata, whose birthday is celebrated on 3 March as Founder's Day. J.N. Tata
        had written to his son Dorabji Tata about his vision of a great city in the area.[16] On Founders Day, the
        225-acre (0.91 km2) Jubilee Park is decorated with brilliant lightwork for about a week.[17]

        The city has several nicknames including "Steel City" (which was referenced during TATA Steel's "Green
        City—Clean City—Steel City" campaign); "Tatanagar" after the name of its railway station Tatanagar Railway
        Station or simply "Tata" in deference to the presence of Tata companies.[18] At one time it was also known as
        "Kalimati" (meaning "Land of Goddess Kali") after the village near the Sakchi area.[18] Sakchi was merged into
        Jamshedpur as a neighbourhood in 1919.[18] The only trace of the name is the main road through Sakchi area of
        Jamshedpur which is named Kalimati Road.
